## Venmo iOS SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/venmo/venmo-ios-sdk.svg?branch=v2)](https://travis-ci.org/venmo/venmo-ios-sdk)

The Venmo iOS SDK lets you make and accept payments in your app using Venmo.

### Installation

*If you're using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):*

 1. If you don't have a Podfile, run `pod init`
 2. Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Venmo-iOS-SDK', '~>1.3'
```

Make sure you run `pod install` to install all of your dependencies, and open your `.xcworkspace` file, not your `.xcodeproj` files!

*If you don't use CocoaPods:*

Clone this repository and add it to your project (this is a multi-step process, but it is possible).
We recommend working with CocoaPods for now.

### Usage

Using the Venmo iOS SDK is as easy as Venmo-ing a friend!

#### 1. Create your app on Venmo
1. Create a new application on the [Venmo developer site](https://venmo.com/account/settings/developers).
2. Make a note of your new app's `app id` and `app secret`.

#### 2. Configure your Xcode project

1. In your app target's `Info` section, scroll down to `URL Types`.
2. Add a new URL Type with the following properties:

	*Identifier:* `venmo<<YOUR_APP_ID>>`

	*URL Schemes:* `venmo<<YOUR_APP_ID>>`

  For example, if your app ID is `1234`, put `venmo1234`.

  ![Set URL Types](http://i.imgur.com/8rUXlFB.png)

  **Note:** If you are using the [Parse SDK](https://parse.com/docs/downloads), and have issues, [this gist](https://gist.github.com/diogeneshamilton/6c1585280da8de16560d) should help you.

3. You will need to update your application's plist to handle the changes to canOpenURL described in https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=703

  If you're recompiling with iOS SDK 9.0, add the following to your application's plist

  ```
  <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
  <array>
      <string>venmo</string>
  </array>
  ```


#### 3. Initialize the Venmo iOS SDK

Add the Venmo SDK header file to your app delegate. Import this header in any of your implementation files to use the SDK.

```obj-c
#import <Venmo-iOS-SDK/Venmo.h>
```

Add the following code to initialize the SDK in your app delegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.

```obj-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    [Venmo startWithAppId:@"VENMO_APP_ID" secret:@"VENMO_APP_SECRET" name:@"VENMO_APP_NAME"];

    return YES;
}
```

* `VENMO_APP_ID`: ***ID*** from your registered app on the [Venmo developer site](https://venmo.com/account/settings/developers)
* `VENMO_APP_SECRET`: ***Secret*** from your registered app on the [Venmo developer site](https://venmo.com/account/settings/developers)
* `VENMO_APP_NAME`: The app name that will show up in the Venmo app (e.g. "sent via My Supercool App")

To allow the Venmo iOS SDK to handle responses from the Venmo app, add the following to your app delegate's `application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:` method:

```obj-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
    if ([[Venmo sharedInstance] handleOpenURL:url]) {
        return YES;
    }
    // You can add your app-specific url handling code here if needed
    return NO;
}
```

#### 4. Choose a transaction method

The Venmo iOS SDK lets you send a payment in two ways:

1. Switching to the Venmo app
    * `[[Venmo sharedInstance] setDefaultTransactionMethod:VENTransactionMethodAppSwitch];`
    * This transaction method will switch the user to a pre-filled payment screen in the Venmo app. After the user sends or cancels the payment, they'll be switched back to your app.
    * If the user doesn't have the Venmo app installed, the payment will fail with an appropriate error.
    * N.B. You should run your app **on a device with the Venmo app installed** to test switching to the Venmo app.

2. Using the Venmo API
    * `[[Venmo sharedInstance] setDefaultTransactionMethod:VENTransactionMethodAPI];`
    * This transaction method won't switch the user to Venmo to make the payment, but _will_ prompt the user to give your app access to their Venmo account. If you want to use this transaction method, you will need to **[request permissions from the user](#5-request-permissions)** _before_ attempting to send a transaction.

If the user doesn't have the Venmo app installed, we recommend sending transactions via the Venmo API.

```objc
if (![Venmo isVenmoAppInstalled]) {
    [[Venmo sharedInstance] setDefaultTransactionMethod:VENTransactionMethodAPI];
}
else {
    [[Venmo sharedInstance] setDefaultTransactionMethod:VENTransactionMethodAppSwitch];
}
```

#### 5. Request permissions

You can request access to a user's Venmo account using `requestPermissions:withCompletionHandler:`. Permissions can be specified with [these scopes](https://developer.venmo.com/docs/authentication#scopes). If the user has the Venmo app installed, `requestPermissions:withCompletionHandler` will switch the user to an authorization page in the Venmo app. Otherwise, the user will be directed to an authorization page in Safari. After granting or denying permissions, the user will be redirected back to your app.

```obj-c
[[Venmo sharedInstance] requestPermissions:@[VENPermissionMakePayments,
                                             VENPermissionAccessProfile]
                     withCompletionHandler:^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {
    if (success) {
        // :)
    }
    else {
        // :(
    }
}];
```

#### 6. Send a payment

After setting the desired transaction method and requesting permissions (if you want to use the Venmo API), you can send payments using `sendPaymentTo:amount:note:completionHandler:`. To send a _payment request_ (a.k.a. charge), use `sendRequestTo:amount:note:completionHandler:`.

```obj-c
[[Venmo sharedInstance] sendPaymentTo:self.toTextField.text
                               amount:self.amountTextField.text.floatValue*100 // this is in cents!
                                 note:self.noteTextField.text
                    completionHandler:^(VENTransaction *transaction, BOOL success, NSError *error) {
    if (success) {
        NSLog(@"Transaction succeeded!");
    }
    else {
        NSLog(@"Transaction failed with error: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
    }
}];
```

### Sample Application

Included in the `sample` directory is a sample application, **MiniVenmo**, which demonstrates how to log in with Venmo and send payments using the Venmo iOS SDK.
